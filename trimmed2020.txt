   The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) 2020;
 
                 Sample Adult data file
 
    This program loads the NHIS sample adult ASCII data file downloaded from the
    NCHS website (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/index.htm) to a SAS dataset.
    The program creates descriptive variable labels and formats with meaningful
    category labels. It sets the variable lengths and uses input statements to
    read in the data. It ends with some sample proc freq calls to verify that
    the data were correctly loaded.
 
    Before running this program, please:
    - Download the sample adult ASCII file to a folder called C:\NHIS2020
      (on a machine running Windows)
    - Configure the macro variables 'nhisfolder', 'adultds' and 'formatcat' below.
      These variables set: the local folder where the ASCII file is located and
      where the SAS dataset will be saved, the name of the sample adult dataset,
      and the name of the catalog where formats are to be saved, respectively.
*/

   permanent SAS dataset will be stored
